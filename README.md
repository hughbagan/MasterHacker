# MasterHacker

1337haxor for your terminal -- MasterHacker makes you look like you are doing some high-level hacking.
Leave this running in a terminal and scare your grandma when she thinks you are a cyber-criminal.

This is a python script. Try running as administrator if it's not working.
Just CTRL+C when you're finished hacking.

Made at the HackED 2018 Hackathon at the University of Alberta. Yes, I wasted an hour on this.

Feel free to add your own "hacking" snippets to the Python script if that's your thing.
